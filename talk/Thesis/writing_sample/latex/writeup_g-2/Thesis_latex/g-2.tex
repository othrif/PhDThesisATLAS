%% 'outhesis.cls' is a class file for a master or phd thesis that
%% conforms to the requirements of the graduate college at the
%% University of Oklahoma. This file is a hacked version of 'book.cls,'
%% that includes all of the formatting requirements set forth in
%% the document 'DissertationInstPacket.pdf' available at
%% http://gradweb.ou.edu/Current/Forms/doctoral/DissertationPagination.pdf
%%
%% This class file relies on a few packages to work.  You must have the
%% following packages installed:
%%  amsfonts, amsmath, amssymb, tikz, lineno, microtype, hyperref
%%
%% Most of these packages are included in distributions of latex.  If you
%% get alot of errors when compiling, check that these packages are
%% installed.
%%
%% By default, the class file will conform to the requirements, but three
%% options are provided for assistance in proofing the document.
%%
%% linenumbers -- turns on linenumbers in the left margin
%% summarypage -- places a page at the beginning of the document listing 
%%                the number of tables, figures, and bibliography items.
%% hyperlinks -- hyperlinks the citations and references for easier
%%                navigation in the document in a reader which supports
%%                hyperlinks.
%%
%% NOTE FOR MASTERS STUDENTS: Open the outhesis.cls file, find the word 
%% "DISSERTATION" and replace with "THESIS" and then save.

\begin{abstract}
Every particle has an intrinsic magnetic moment due to its spin angular momentum characterized by a constant g, called the gyromagnetic ratio, that is very close to the value 2. The experimental measurement of this quantity to a very high accuracy has made it one of the most precisely measured quantities in particle physics. This measurement when compared with the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics shows a difference in the order of 3 standard deviation which suggests the possibility of new physics. The goal of this review is to describe the measurements done in the past, and the improvements that the Fermilab g-2 experiment will achieve.
