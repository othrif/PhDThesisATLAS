\subsection{Models already considered in Run-1}
Given the high increase in the center of mass energy, and therefore in the background and signal production cross sections, the signal regions used for the Run-1 analysis have to be re-optimized to maximize the sensitivity. Employing a similar methodology as in~\cite{noteSS3L}, the optimization is performed for a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt s$~=~13~\TeV\ and a luminosity ($L$) of 3~\ifb, as a function of the $b$-jet and lepton multiplicities. The discriminating variables used to separate the signal from the background are \met, \meff, number of jets and leptons, and their \pt\ threshold. In Table~\ref{tab:SR_Paper2015} the previous defined signal regions are presented, and further used as a benchmark.

For all signal regions, two same-sign or three leptons with \pt~$>$~[20,15,15] \GeV\ are required. Jets ($b$-jets) are selected with $\pt > $ 40 \GeV\ (20 \GeV). }

The optimization is performed using as figure of merit the signal discovery significance (Zn). This is calculated with {\tt RooStats::NumberCountingUtils::BinominalObsZ}. This function requires as inputs the observed number of events (equals to SUSY signal plus SM background), the expected SM background events, and the uncertainty on these SM background expectation (40$\%$). For a complete coverage, three different approaches for the lepton selection are considered: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Inclusive SS leptons: at least two same sign leptons are considered in the event.}
\item{Exclusive SS leptons: exactly two same sign leptons.}
\item{Exclusive three leptons: exactly three leptons.}
\end{itemize}
The cut on number of $b$-jets in the signal regions is also optimized, and four different cases are studied: 
\begin{itemize}
\item{Inclusive 3 $b$-jets: at least three $b$-jets in the event.}
\item{Exclusive 1 $b$-jet: similarly to Run-1 SR1b. It requires at least one $b$-jet, and no event with $\ge$3 $b$-jets and several jets. The latter cut is considered to mimic a potential SR3b signal region.}
\item{Inclusive 1 $b$-jet: at least one $b$-jet and no requirement on the events with three $b$-jets.}
\item{Exclusive 0 $b$-jet: no $b$-jet requirement is considered in the event.}
\end{itemize}
The final signal regions definition is chosen by looking at the signal significance, after comparing the inclusive and exclusive potential signal regions. It is a balance between a high sensitivity and a reduced number of final regions. As a result of the optimization, only four SRs are defined, and presented in Table~\ref{tab:SRdef1}. The signal region with an inclusive lepton selection and at least three $b$-jets is defined to cover the region of the SUSY phase space with a high gluino mass. For the compressed spectra, an additional signal region will be defined, as shown in the results section. Compared to the previous signal regions, the combined SR3Lep and the exactly two same sign leptons SR1b or SR0b signal regions are replaced by inclusive same sign leptons SR1b and SR0b. This retains a more simple analysis, suitable to analyze the first data. Two overlapping regions are defined for the selection with no $b$-jets in the event, and assure a high sensitivity in models with gluino mediated squarks and direct squarks. Sr0b5j is defined for SUSY signatures like gluino pair production via $WZ$, while SR0b3j for signals like direct squarks via sleptons. If no separation in terms of jet multiplicity is performed, the reached sensitivity is generally decreased by a factor 2 for the studied models. The signal region with at least one $b$-jet is orthogonal to SR0b5j and SR0b3j, and targets the signatures with 1 or 2 b jets in the cascade decays. When compared to the performance obtained with the Run-1 SRs, an increase in significance is observed (see the results section).

\paragraph{Inclusive same  sign leptons and 1 $b$-jet signal region\\}
During the optimization, a combined version of {Run-1 SR1b and SR3b} signal regions was also considered (the inclusive 1 $b$-jet case presented previously). This study is performed looking at gluino mediated virtual stop and direct sbottom models with RPC and $\chi_1^0$ being the LSP, as generally motivated by \textit{natural SUSY}. The optimization results are pointing to the generally favoured selection presented in Table~\ref{tab:def_SR1b_inclLepB}. It requires at least 4 jets, $\met>150$~\GeV and a tight cut on \meff\ to reduce the background and increase the sensitivity at high gluino and low LSP masses. 
The expected fake lepton background is 2.89, while the prompt SS background of 3.38 when considering $L$~=~3~\ifb. 
This region is not suitable in the compressed region of (see Figure~\ref{fig:map_MET_Meff_Gtt}, where only a significance of 1.4 can be achieved for a mass splitting of 600~GeV between gluino and neutralino), or in the non-excluded region of the direct sbottom model (Figure~\ref{fig:map_MET_Meff_directSb}, which is showing one the signal points with larger significance for this model, and it can only reach values of 1.88). 
The optimization is still work in progress, and the signal region definition might change. 
Work is ongoing to define a signal region targeting theses regions of the phase space. 
%A signal region targeting these regions of the phase space is work in progress. 

\subsection{Softer selection with 3$b$-jets} 

It was noticed in the 8~\TeV signal samples for the gluino stop offshell model with the most compressed mass spectrums, 
that the signal acceptance could be significantly increased for a similar level of background, by relying on softer jets (20~\GeV instead of 40~\GeV), 
but increasing the requirements on the multiplicity ($\geq 7$ jets was found optimal). 
We are considering the possibility of implementing such a signal region, which could for example take the form of the jet multiplicity distribution 
in events with two same-sign leptons and three $b$-jets. 
The expected number of events for such a distribution can be found in section~\ref{sec:fit}, 
together with estimates of the sensitivity this signal region would bring.

\subsection{RPV models} 

The main topologies described in Section~\ref{subsec:RPVmodel} and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rpv_diagram} lead to the same final state: 
 \begin{align}
\ell^{\pm} \ell^{\pm} + b{\rm{-jets}} + {\rm{jets}} + \met
 \end{align}
 with two leptons and two $b$-jets coming from the top quarks decay, extra jets and eventually $b$-jets coming from the decay of the $d$-squark or the gluino and the \met\ coming from the neutrinos from the top quarks decay.

 An optimization of signal region for this model was performed and will be soon written out on this note. The main aspects of the optimized signal region are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\geq 2$ leptons 
\item $\geq 1$ $b$-jets 
\item $\geq 3$ jets 
\item $H_{\rm T} = \Sigma \pt^{jet} \geq \ \sim 150$~\GeV\
\item No cut on \met\ and $M_{\rm T}$ 
\end{itemize}

 The cuts on the number of $b$-jets and jets are relaxed in order to take into account the boosted region.
 Indeed, the on-shell gluinos and $d$-squarks can be so boosted that their decay products are very close and 
 not all the jets and $b$-jets are reconstructed.

A tight cut on the overall jet activity in the event is the main cut to
reject the background. The $H_{\rm T}$ variable was chosen among other
variables, such as $H_{\rm T}' = \Sigma \pt^{jet} + \Sigma \pt^{lep}$
and $M_{\rm{eff}} = \Sigma\pt^{jet} + \Sigma\pt^{lep} + \met$, because
it leads to the best results in terms of significance.
  The exact cut value will be optimized with a future more accurate study.
  
 However, a minimal cut should be applied on \met\ and $M_{\rm T}$. These cuts were originally applied for the search for neutralinos for RPC models and to reject the main background coming from the neutrinos from the decay of $W$.
 Since in RPV models our signal is composed of neutrinos, it is necessary that these cuts should be as low as possible in order to avoid the losses in signal acceptance. 
Table~\ref{tab:RPV_SR_Significance} shows the signal acceptance Zn computed assuming a 40\% background uncertainty and 
using the signal samples at truth level. 
For those numbers, no $b$-tagging is used, and the $b$-jets were assigned according to their truth flavor in both background and signal samples.
%One can be convinced by the performance of this signal region with the Table~\ref{tab:RPV_SR_Significance}.
