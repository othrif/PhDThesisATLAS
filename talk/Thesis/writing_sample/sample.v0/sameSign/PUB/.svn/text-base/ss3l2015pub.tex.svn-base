\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supersymmetry (SUSY)~\cite{Golfand:1971iw,Volkov:1973ix,Wess:1974tw,Wess:1974jb,Ferrara:1974pu,Salam:1974ig} is one of the most studied frameworks to extend the Standard Model (SM) beyond the electroweak scale; a general review can be found in Ref.~\cite{Martin:1997ns}. 
In its minimal realisation (MSSM)~\cite{Fayet:1976et,Fayet:1977yc} 
it predicts a new bosonic (fermionic) partner for each fundamental SM fermion (boson), 
as well as an additional Higgs doublet. 
If $R$-parity is conserved~\cite{Farrar:1978xj} the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and is typically the lightest neutralino\footnote{The SUSY partners of the Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons mix to form
the mass eigenstates known as charginos ($\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{l}$, $l = 1, 2$ ordered by
increasing mass) and neutralinos ($\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{m}$, $m = 1, \ldots, 4$ ordered by increasing
mass).} \ninoone. 
Only such scenarios are considered in this paper. 
In many models, the LSP can be a viable dark matter candidate~\cite{Goldberg:1983nd,Ellis:1983ew} 
and produce collider signatures with large missing transverse momentum. 


In order to address the SM hierarchy problem with SUSY models
~\cite{Sakai:1981gr,Dimopoulos:1981yj,Ibanez:1981yh,Dimopoulos:1981zb}, 
TeV-scale masses are required~\cite{Barbieri:1987fn,deCarlos:1993yy} 
for the partners of the gluons (gluinos~\gluino) 
and of the top quark chiral degrees of freedom (top squarks \stopL and \stopR), 
due to the large top Yukawa coupling. 
The latter also favours significant $\stopL$--$\stopR$ mixing, 
so that the lighter mass eigenstate $\stopone$ is in many scenarios lighter than the other squarks~\cite{Inoue:1982pi,Ellis:1983ed}. 
Bottom squarks may also be light, being bound to top squarks by $SU(2)_{\rm L}$ invariance. 
This leads to potentially large production cross-sections 
for gluino pairs ($\gluino\gluino$), top--antitop squark pairs ($\stopone\stoponebar$) and bottom--antibottom squark pairs ($\sbottomone\sbottomonebar$) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)~\cite{Borschensky:2014cia}. 
Production of isolated leptons may arise in the cascade decays of those superpartners to SM quarks and neutralinos~\ninoone, 
via intermediate neutralinos~$\tilde\chi^0_{2,3,4}$ or charginos~$\tilde\chi^\pm_{1,2}$ 
that in turn lead to $W$, $Z$ or Higgs bosons, or to lepton superpartners (sleptons). 
Lighter third-generation squarks would also enhance $\gluino\to t\stoponebar$ or $\gluino\to b\sbottomonebar$ branching ratios over the generic decays involving light-flavour squarks,
favouring the production of heavy flavour quarks and, in the case of top quarks, additional leptons. 

This paper 
presents a search for SUSY in final states 
with two leptons (electrons or muons) of the same electric charge (referred to as same-sign (SS) leptons) or three leptons (3L) in any charge combination, 
jets and missing transverse momentum (${\vec p}^{\rm miss}_{\rm T}$, whose magnitude is referred to as \met). 
It is an extension to $\sqrt s=13$ TeV of an earlier search performed by ATLAS with $\sqrt s=8$ TeV data~\cite{paperSS3L}, 
and uses the data collected by the ATLAS experiment~\cite{PERF-2007-01} in proton--proton ($pp$) collisions during 2015. 
Despite the much lower integrated luminosity collected at $\sqrt s=13$~TeV compared to that collected at $\sqrt s=8$~TeV, 
a similar or improved sensitivity at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV is expected 
due to the much larger cross-sections predicted for the production of SUSY particles with masses at the TeV scale. 
A similar search for SUSY in this topology was also performed by the CMS Collaboration~\cite{Chatrchyan:2013fea} at $\sqrt s=8$~TeV.
While the same-sign leptons signature is present in many scenarios of physics beyond the SM (BSM), 
SM processes leading to such final states have very small cross-sections. 
Compared to many other BSM searches, analyses based on same-sign leptons therefore allow 
the use of looser kinematic requirements (for example, on \met or the momentum of jets and leptons), 
preserving sensitivity to scenarios with small mass differences between gluinos/squarks and the LSP, or in which $R$-parity is not conserved~\cite{paperSS3L}. 

The sensitivity to a wide range of models is illustrated by the interpretation of the results  
in the context of four different SUSY benchmark processes that may lead to same-sign or three-lepton signatures. 
The first two scenarios focus on gluino pair production with generic decays into light quarks and multiple leptons, 
either involving light sleptons, $\gluino\to q\bar q\ninotwo\to q\bar q \ell\slepton^*\to q\bar q\ell^+\ell^-\ninoone$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_gg2sl}), 
or mediated by a cascade involving $\chinoonepm$ and $\ninotwo$, 
$\gluino \to q\bar q'\chinoonepm\to q\bar q'W^\pm\ninotwo\to q\bar q'W^\pm Z\ninoone$  (Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_gg2WZ}). 
The other two scenarios are motivated by the expectation that the third-generation squarks are lighter than the other squarks 
and target the direct production of $\sbottomone\sbottomonebar$ pairs 
with subsequent chargino-mediated $\sbottomone\to tW^-\ninoone$ decays (Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_b1b1})  
or the production of $\gluino\gluino$ pairs decaying as $\gluino\to t\bar t\ninoone$ via an off-shell top squark (Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_gtt}).

Four signal regions (SRs) are designed to achieve good sensitivity for these SUSY scenarios, mainly characterised by the number of $b$-tagged jets or reconstructed leptons. 
They are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:selection}, preceded by descriptions of the experimental apparatus~(Section~\ref{sec:detector}) and
the simulated samples~(Section~\ref{sec:dataMC}).
Section~\ref{sec:bkg} is devoted to the estimation of the
contribution from SM processes to the signal regions, 
validated by comparisons with data in dedicated regions. 
The results are presented in Section~\ref{sec:result}, 
together with the statistical tests used to interpret the results in the context of the SUSY benchmark scenarios. 
Finally, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} summarises the main conclusions of this paper.

\section{The ATLAS detector}
\label{sec:detector}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ATLAS experiment~\cite{PERF-2007-01} is a multi-purpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical
geometry and nearly $4\pi$ coverage in solid angle.\footnote{ATLAS uses
  a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal
  interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the
  $z$-axis along the beam pipe. The $x$-axis points from the IP to the
  centre of the LHC ring, and the $y$-axis points upward. Cylindrical
  coordinates ($r$, $\phi$) are used in the transverse plane, $\phi$
  being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity
  is defined in terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as $\eta = -\ln
  \tan(\theta/2)$. Rapidity is defined as $y=0.5 \ln\left[(E + p_z )/(E - p_z )\right]$ where $E$ denotes the energy and $p_z$ is the component of the momentum along the beam direction.}
The interaction point is surrounded by an inner detector (ID), a
calorimeter system, and a muon spectrometer.

The ID provides precision tracking of charged particles for
pseudorapidities $|\eta| < 2.5$ and is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a \SI{2}{T} axial magnetic field.
It consists of pixel and silicon-microstrip detectors inside a
transition radiation tracker.  
One significant upgrade for the $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV running period is the presence of the
Insertable B-Layer~\cite{CERN-LHCC-2010-013}, an additional pixel layer close to the interaction point, which 
provides high-resolution hits at small radius to improve the tracking performance.

In the pseudorapidity region $|\eta| < 3.2$, high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr)
electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeters are used.
A steel/scintillator tile calorimeter measures hadron energies for
$|\eta| < 1.7$.
The endcap and forward regions, spanning $1.5<|\eta| <4.9$, are 
instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic
measurements.

The muon spectrometer consists of three large superconducting toroids
with eight coils each, 
a system of trigger and precision-tracking chambers, 
which provide triggering and tracking capabilities in the
ranges $|\eta| < 2.4$ and $|\eta| < 2.7$, respectively.

A two-level trigger system is used to select events. The first-level
trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector
information. This is followed by the software-based High-Level Trigger stage,
which can run offline reconstruction and
calibration software, reducing the event rate to about \SI{1}{kHz}.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A search for supersymmetry in events with exactly two same-sign leptons or at least three leptons, multiple jets, 
$b$-jets and $\met$ is presented. 
The analysis is performed with proton--proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2~fb$^{-1}$. 
With no significant excess over the Standard Model expectation observed,
results are interpreted in the framework of simplified models featuring gluino and bottom squark production.
In the $\gluino\gluino$ simplified models considered, $m_{\gluino}\lesssim 1.1$--$1.3~\TeV$ and $m_{\ninoone}\lesssim 550$--$850~\GeV$ 
are excluded at 95\% confidence level depending on the model parameters. Bottom squark masses of $m_{\sbottomone}\lesssim 540~\GeV$ 
are also excluded for a light $\ninoone$ in a $\sbottomone\sbottomonebar$ simplified model with $\sbottomone\to tW^-\ninoone$.
These results are complementary to those of previous searches and extend the exclusion limits they set.
