The main challenge, in this analysis, is to achieve reliable predictions of the low Standard Model background 
leading to the same-sign leptons + jets final state. 
This background is composed partly of rare processes such as the associate production of a top quark pair with a massive boson, 
or the production of multiple bosons. 
The other contribution consists in experimental backgrounds originating from the imperfect discrimination between prompt leptons and other objects, 
or the occasional misreconstruction of the electron charge. 
The following sections provide more details about the nature of these different categories of background, 
and the foreseen methods that will be used to estimate their contributions to the signal regions.

\subsection{Backgrounds with prompt SS dilepton or three leptons}
\label{sec:bkg_prompt}

There are two main sources of Standard Model background leading to pairs of same-sign prompt leptons: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] The associate production of top quark(s) and massive bosons, where the same-sign leptons pair 
originates from leptonic decays of one of the top quarks and of the boson. 
These processes are characterized by a large jet multiplicity, the presence of $b$-jet(s), 
and always have intrinsic missing momentum. 
Therefore they generally represent the largest contribution to the signal regions. 
The dominant processes are $pp\to t\bar{t}W(j)$, $pp\to t\bar{t}Z(j)$ and $pp\to t\bar{t}H$, 
while there are also minor contributions from $pp\to tZbj,\,t\bar{t}WW$, and $pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$. 
\item[$\bullet$] The production of multiple massive bosons. 
These processes have generally low jet multiplicities. 
However, due to their larger cross-sections, they contribute in a significant way to the background entering signal regions without $b$-jets requirements. 
The dominant processes include $pp\to W^\pm W^\pm jj,\,WZ,\,ZZ$, 
with minor contributions from $pp\to\,WH,\,ZH,\,VVV$ and $H\to\,ZZ\to\,\ell\ell\ell\ell$ or $H\to\,WW\to\,\ell\nu +X$. 
\end{itemize}

We estimate the contributions of these various processes to the signal regions by relying on the Monte-Carlo predictions, 
normalized with the best known theoretical cross-sections: these processes are too rare to allow use of control regions until a significant integrated luminosity will be collected. 
For example, in~\cite{Ducu:2021084} which establishes projections of the sensitivity 
to the $ttH$ signal strength in a final state very similar to this analysis, 
the impact of adding control regions for $t\bar t+V$ processes was found to be favorable only after collecting $\sim 100$~\ifb~of data. 

Processes containing top quarks ($\ttbar + X$) have cross-sections below 1~pb, which have consequently not yet been much constrained experimentally. On the theoretical side, uncertainties on the cross sections are typically large: 30\% for $t\bar{t}W$ and 50\% for $t\bar{t}Z$ for the same-sign $\sqrt{s}=7$~TeV analysis~\cite{NoteSS3L_7TeV}, 22\% for both $t\bar{t}W$ and $t\bar{t}Z$ for the $\sqrt{s}=8$~TeV analysis~\cite{noteSS3L}. 

Cross-sections for diboson processes are known with a rather good accuracy, but only for the inclusive processes, 
while we are mostly interested in processes where several additional partons are produced, 
which carry subsequent additional uncertainties. 

The validation regions described in section~\ref{sec:bkg_VR} help us to ensure that our understanding of these processes is sufficiently reliable, and that the systematic uncertainties assigned to the estimated rates are reasonable.

\subsection{Neglected backgrounds}
\label{sec:bkg_neglected}
Other sources of background such as cosmic rays or cavern background, as well as pile-up events where two distinct proton-proton pairs may interact and produce leptons, 
have been evaluated in the past and found to be negligible. 
Multiple scattering effects are partially included in the simulations but are also not expected to contribute enough to require in-depth studies; 
the largest identified contribution is given more attention in the following section. 

\subsubsection{Double-parton scattering}

The contribution for $W^\pm+W^\pm$ arising from two different parton interactions in the same
proton-proton collision, in a double parton scattering process (DPS) could be relevant in the SR0b5j.

DPS effects are implemented in Sherpa diboson samples used in the analysis in the case of $V+jj$, but not for $W^\pm+W^\pm$. 
To estimate a conservative upper bound on the number of 
events which might arise from DPS, a standard ansatz is adopted: in this, 
for a collision in which a hard process (X) occurs, the probability that 
an additional (distinguishable) process (Y) occurs is parametrized as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{DPS}_{XY} = \sigma^{}_{X}\sigma^{}_{Y}/\sigma^{}_{eff}
\end{equation} 
where $\sigma^{}_{X}$ is the production cross section of the hard 
process X and $\sigma^{}_{eff}$ (effective area parameter) 
parameterizes the double-parton interaction part of the production 
cross section for the composite system (X+Y). 
A value of $\sigma^{}_{eff}$ is 10-20~mb is assumed in this study (as obtained from 7~TeV measurements, and with no observed dependence on $\sqrt{s}$), and it is 
independent on the processes involved. For the case of $W^\pm+W^\pm$ production:
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{DPS}_{W^\pm W^\pm} = \frac{ \sigma^{}_{W^+}\sigma^{}_{W^+} + \sigma^{}_{W^-}\sigma^{}_{W^-}}{\sigma^{}_{eff}} \simeq 0.09-0.18\text{ pb.}
%\frac{\sigma^{}_{W^+}\sigma^{}_{W^+} + 
%\sigma^{}_{W^-}\sigma^{}_{W^}}{dsfds}
%\sigma^{}_{eff}
\end{equation} 
%\sim 0.09-0.18 pb.

To evaluate a potential contribution to the signal region, the value of $\sigma^{DPS}_{W^\pm W^\pm}$ needs to be put in common with the jet multiplicity and $\met$ of that process. In absence of a suitable MC sample, and despite the many caveats involved, we overlaid pairs of events from the standard $W$+jet samples at the ntuple level (adding all the objects in the event and the $\met$ $x$ and $y$ components, without further corrections to lepton isolation or other variables). The jet multiplicity distributions obtained from that procedure are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:DPSWW}. Normalizing those distributions to the expected $\sigma^{DPS}_{W^\pm W^\pm}$ cross section, one can roughly estimate a contribution after the 5-jet cuts in SR0b5j of approximately 0.001-0.01 events for 4~fb$^{-1}$, and therefore can be safely be neglected within this analysis.

\section{Alternative methods for background estimates}
\label{sec:bkg_alternatives}

To further cross-check some of our background estimates, 
we compare their predictions to those obtained through alternative methods, that rely on different assumptions. 
This section describes these alternative methods: 
the first one (section~\ref{sec:bkg_mctemplate_method}) evaluates the fake lepton background with the help of the MC simulations, 
while the second one (section~\ref{sec:bkg_bjetfakes}) provides a data-driven estimate of the rate of mis-tagged $b$-jets.

%\subsection{Statistical tools improving robustness in low statistics regime}
%\label{sec:bkg_fakes_stattools}

% Some alternatives to the matrix method have been considered, 
% based on the same principles but with more formal constructions as probabilistic tools 
% (hence a better behaviour in conditions far from the asymptotic regime), and are currently being developed. 
% One of these methods~\cite{PseudoLikelihoodMatrixMethod} relies on the construction of a likelihood function 
% which translates the equation system~(\ref{eqn:matrixmethod}) in terms of probabilities for single leptons, 
% instead of relationships between mean values; this also allows to treat $\epsilon$ and $\zeta$ as nuisance parameters 
% (according to their measurements uncertainties) instead of being frozen. 
% One could then simply estimate the rates of prompt and fake leptons as the maximum likelihood estimators of the observations, 
% but the large number of parameters (several leptons per event hence many possible loose/tight combinations, 
% binned probabilities $\epsilon$ and $\zeta$\ldots) renders this approach impractical. 
% A simplification is discussed in~\cite{PseudoLikelihoodMatrixMethod,TomThesis}, which preserves some advantages over the standard matrix method. 

% Another approach has been proposed recently~\cite{TomThesis}, 
% consisting in building confidence intervals on the rate of fake leptons from the associated Bayesian posterior, 
% which may be numerically computed with Gibbs sampling. 
% The claimed advantages are a better assessment of the uncertainties on the final estimate, 
% since the whole posterior distribution is known, as well as the absence of issues 
% with local minima which might affect likelihood-based methods. More details can be found in~\cite{TomThesis}. 

% We are planning to check if these methods can be applied with all the complexity of a real world analysis, 
% in which case they would bring quite a nice improvement to the current way of predicting fake lepton background in the signal regions. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Backgrounds with fake $b$-jets}
\label{sec:bkg_bjetfakes}

In the signal regions requiring at least three $b$-jets, an important part of the background originates from processes 
with two real $b$-jets, and a third jet not originating from a $b$-quark but satisfying the $b$-tagging requirements. 
Unlike the case of fake leptons, the $b$-tagging performance group usually provides corrections (and associated uncertainties) 
to correct the simulation for mismodelling both of real and fake $b$-jets. The fake leptons and charge flip background, being predicted from data, obviously do not need any correction. 

%An alternative data-driven method was used in Run-1 as cross-check, 

%consisting in the equivalent of the lepton matrix method but applying on jets and replacing lepton tight requirements by the output weight of the $b$-tagging algorithm. This approach was primarily developed for the ATLAS SUSY search with 0/1 lepton and 3 $b$-jets~\cite{SUSY3bjetsRun1}. It could be considered again for Run-2.
