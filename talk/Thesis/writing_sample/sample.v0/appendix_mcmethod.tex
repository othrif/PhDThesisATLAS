\section{Further details on the MC template method}
\label{app_mc_template}
	
In order to validate the fitting machinery, we performed pseudo-experiments where the toy data is obtained 
by randomly sampling the summed contribution from the six categories according to a Poisson distribution. 
Pull plots are obtained for each fake rate as shown in Figure \ref{f:pull_test}. 
Overall, the mean is consistent with zero and the standard deviation is close to unity as expected.

In our classification, we assumed that the $b$-tagging requirement only affects the rate of leptons coming from $b$-hadrons. 
As a sanity check of this assumption, we also include fake leptons coming from c-hadron decays in HF 
with the leptons coming from $b$-hadrons and re-do the fit. 
The comparison is shown in Table~\ref{t:compare_b_bc} using pseudo-data which shows that there is a negligeable effect in including $c$-jet induced fakes. 

 \begin{table}[!htb]
  \caption{The fake-rate and charge flip corrections obtained in the cases where fakes from c-hadrons are categorized separate from fakes from $b$-hadrons and  when they are categorized in the same category. A negligeable effect is observed. The MC templates are normalized to 2 \ifb of integrated luminosity.
