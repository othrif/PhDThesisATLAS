The reducible backgrounds consist of the charge-flip background and 
the FNP lepton background.
The charge flip background is obtained by re-weighting opposite-sign 
lepton pairs data with the measured charge-flip probability and cross checked 
with the estimate obtained with the MC template method.
Two data-driven methods are used to estimate the FNP lepton background, 
the matrix method and the MC template method,
which are combined to obtain the final estimate.  
These methods were discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:fake}.
This section describes the application of these methods in the 
context of the SS/3L analysis and the validation of the reducible 
background estimates.
