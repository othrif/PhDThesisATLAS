ATLAS-CONF-2016-045-dimuon.png     

Dimuon event with the highest invariant mass (1.98 TeV) selected in the search for new high-mass resonances in the dilepton final state (ATLAS-CONF-2016-045). Red lines represents the reconstructed tracks associated to the two selected muon candidates. The light blue line corresponds to an additional muon in the event. Cyan lines corresponds to tracks from secondary interactions.

Event selected in the search for the associated production of a Higgs Boson and a Top Quark pair in multilepton final states (ATLAS-CONF-2016-058). The blue tracks are the two selected electrons. Green and yellow bars indicate energy deposits in the electromagnetic (liquid argon) and hadronic (tile) calorimeters, respectively. In the inset display, the three azure cones are b-tagged jets and the yellow cones are the six non-b-tagged jets.

Dielectron event with the highest invariant mass (2.38 TeV) selected in the search for new high-mass resonances in the dilepton final state (ATLAS-CONF-2016-045). Green towers represent the energy deposits in the cells of the electromagnetic calorimeter for the two selected electron candidates. Red lines represents the reconstructed tracks associated to the two selected electron candidates. Cyan lines correspond to tracks from secondary interactions.
