The systematic uncertainties related to the estimated background from same-sign prompt leptons arise from the experimental uncertainties 
%(jet energy scale calibration, 
%jet energy resolution and $b$-tagging efficiency) 
as well as theoretical modelling and theoretical cross-section uncertainties.
The statistical uncertainty of the simulated event samples is also taken into account.
