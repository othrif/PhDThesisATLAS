The reducible backgrounds consist of the FNP lepton background and 
the charge-flip background.
Two data-driven methods are used to estimate the FNP lepton background, 
referred to as the ``matrix method'' and the ``MC template method''.
These methods were discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:fake}
and combined to give the final estimate. 
The charge flip background is obtained by re-weighting opposite-sign 
lepton pairs data with measured charge-flip probability and cross checked 
with the estimate obtained with the MC template method.
This section describes the application of these methods in this 
analysis.
