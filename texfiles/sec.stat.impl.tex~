The statistical interpretations of the observations 
are performed with the \texttt{HistFitter} framework~\cite{Baak:2014wma}, commonly in use within the SUSY ATLAS working group. 
It consists of a user-friendly abstraction layer to the \texttt{HistFactory} and \texttt{RooFit} frameworks~\cite{Cranmer:1456844,Verkerke:2003ir}, 
to which it delegates the tasks of building a probabilistic representation of the analysis, and performing hypothesis tests. 
\texttt{HistFitter} also provides several related utilities, 
such as the creation of summary tables of yields and uncertainties, or the creation of exclusion plots such as those presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:res}.

The likelihood function implemented in \texttt{HistFitter} is built as the 
product of a Poisson probability density function describing the observed 
number of events in the signal region 
and, to constrain the nuisance parameters associated with the systematic 
uncertainties, 
Gaussian distributions whose widths correspond to the sizes of these 
uncertainties; 
Poisson distributions are used instead for MC simulation statistical 
uncertainties.
Correlations of a given nuisance parameter between the backgrounds and the 
signal are taken into account when relevant. 
The hypothesis tests are performed for each of the signal regions 
independently. 
In order to determine which signal region is used to set an exclusion limit 
on a particular model, the expected $CL_s$ value is computed for each signal 
region at a given point in the signal parameter space. The signal 
region with the smallest expected  $CL_s$ value (more disagreement with data 
under the signal hypothesis) is used to set an exclusion limit on the model.
