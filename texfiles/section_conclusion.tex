A search for supersymmetry in events with two same-sign leptons or at least three leptons, multiple jets, 
$b$-jets and large $\met$ and/or large $\meff$ is presented. 
The analysis is performed with proton--proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$ 
collected in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider 
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$. 
With no significant excess over the Standard Model prediction observed,
results are interpreted in the framework of simplified models featuring gluino 
and squark production in $R$-parity-conserving and $R$-parity-violating scenarios. Lower limits on particle 
masses are derived at 95\% confidence level. 
In the $\gluino\gluino$ simplified RPC models considered, gluinos with masses up to 1.85~TeV
are excluded in scenarios with a light $\ninoone$. RPC models with bottom squark masses below 700~GeV
are also excluded in a $\sbottomone\sbottomonebar$ simplified model with $\sbottomone\to tW^-\ninoone$ and a light $\ninoone$. 
In RPV scenarios, masses of down squark-rights are probed up to $m_{\tilde d_\mathrm{R}}\approx$ 500~GeV. 
All models with gluino masses below 1.3 TeV are excluded, greatly extending the previous exclusion limits.
Model-independent limits on the cross-section of a possible signal contribution to the signal regions are set.
