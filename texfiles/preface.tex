Over the past five years, 
I have always been asked by family, friends, 
and people I meet, what do you do.
I have written the introduction with a general audience in mind to answer this
question.

The search for supersymmetry is one of the highest priorities of the 
Large hadron Collider (LHC) program. Both ATLAS and CMS has carried out a 
vigorous search program to analyze the fast incoming data at a higher 
center of mass energy. 

This dissertation is the result of my won work, except where explicit 
reference is made to the work of others. 
The regulations of the ATLAS collaboration requires me to inculde 
the ``ATLAS'' label in the plots that have used ATLAS data or 
ATLAS simulation. 


The analysis of proton-proton collision data from the LHC in the final state 
with two same sign leptons or three leptons and jets is the main part of the 
work presented in this dissertation. 
The conclusions provide relevant results to help guide the particle physics 
community into rulling out a large variety of supersymmetric models.
