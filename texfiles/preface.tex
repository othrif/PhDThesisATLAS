In the spring of 2014, I received an ATLAS Support Center graduate fellowship to move to Argonne National Laboratory 
to work on hardware and physics analysis.
This thesis is based on the work conducted in the period of May 2014 to May 2017. 
In my research, the supervision of Dr. Brad Abbott has been invaluable. 


There is a very long list of people I would like to thank. 
I would like to thank the Argonne group for the warm welcome to the physics division at Argonne.
The scientits at Argonne became colleagues and friends. 

The working conditions either in Oklahoma, Argonne, or CERN have been excellent. 
I had the privileage of interacting with many interesting people at these institutes which I contributed 
significantly to building my independence as a physicist. 
I habe been particularly fortunate of being part of Argonne National Laboratory.
where I am able to work with many talented physicsits. 
I would like to start with Alexander Paramonov and Sergei Chekanov who were the first to introduce me to physics analysi.
Robert Blair, Jeremy Love, and Jinlong Zhang with whom I evolved the glorious region of interest builder of ATLAS 
responsible for processing every event recorded by the ATLAS detector. 
It was a real joy working with them and bringing the project to completion and taking data in ATLAS.
It is fair to say that James Proudfoot became a mentor to me during my stay at Argonne and afterwards.
Furthermore, my gratitude goes to Ximo Poveda, Julien Maurer, and Otilia Ducu who made my work within the same sign SUSY 
group a real joy.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and frineds for their support and acceptance of my absence from their lives.
Last, but not least, I thank ... encouragement and patience during these years.
