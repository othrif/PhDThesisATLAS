The goal of the analysis is to maximize the information that can be 
extracted from comparing the observed data to the background 
prediction in the signal regions designed to search for new physics 
topologies. Statistical tools are essential to tell in the most 
powerful way and to the best of our knowledge if there is a new physics 
signal beyond what is already known in the observed data. 
At the same time, it is important to properly treat the systematic 
uncertainties associated with the complexity of the experimental 
apparatus (ATLAS detector) and the background predictions when 
presenting an interpretation of the results. 
%%  we would like to answer the following questions:
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item Does the data contain evidence for new particles or interactions not 
%% accounted for by the background prediction?
%% \item What is the most powerful test statistic that can differentiate 
%%   the standard model expectation from a hypothesized new signal?
%% \item If there is a signal, what is its statistical significance?
%% \item In the absence of a signal, can it be excluded at a given confidence 
%%   level? 
%% \end{itemize}
