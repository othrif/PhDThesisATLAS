\subsection{ATLAS Operation}

The reliable operation of the different ATLAS systems directly impacts the 
efficiency of the ATLAS experiment 
in recording the $p-p$ collisions delivered by the LHC. 
As a result, high data-taking efficiency is crucial 
for the ATLAS physics program. 

All the ATLAS subdetectors have operated with a very high efficiency 
($93-95\%$) as shown in Table~\ref{tab:atlas.detstatus} for the 2016 
data taking run.
\input{texfiles/tables/dqphys.tex}
The ATLAS recorded efficiency in 2016 is over 90\%, as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:tdaq_diagram} with a negligible fraction of data loss due to 
the ATLAS DAQ system. 
The ATLAS dataflow architecture is scaling well with the increased 
instantaneous luminosity during 2016 data-taking and is capable of handling 
larger pileup and thus larger event sizes.
For illustration,  Figure \ref{fig:run_pileup} shows the evolution of the 
average processing time per event and 
the event size where there is relatively mild increase as a function of pileup 
which is well within the system capacity.

The excellent operations of the ATLAS detector during 2015 and 2016 is 
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:exp.op.intlumi} where the ATLAS detector 
recorded almost 92\% of the luminosity delivered by the LHC.
