There is a very long list of people I would like to thank.

First and foremost, thanks to my advisor Brad Abbott for his continuous support over these past years. 
Brad gave me enough freedom to pursue the projects I felt most pationate about and at the same time be 
there to guide me through all the decisions I had to make during my PhD.

Thanks to the rest of the OU HEP faculty: Michael Strauss, Patrick Skubic, Phillip Gutierrez, and John Stupak. I have enjoyed 
interacting with all of you and getting feedback on the numerous practice talks I gave to the group.

Thanks to the whole Argonne National Laboratory HEP group. I spent one year with the group in the context of an ATLAS Support Center 
fellowship, this year was one of the best periods of my PhD experience. I would like to particularly thank Bob Blair, Jeremy Love, 
Jinlong Zhang, and James Proudfoot in working together to make the evolution of the ATLAS Region of Interest Builder a success. 
We replaced the two-decade-old system that ``discovered the Higgs'', as Jeremy likes to say, with a modern solution.
The new system integration and commissioning in ATLAS went so smoothly that barely anyone noticed, a testament of a job well done,
keeping in mind that a failure of this system would have hindered the data-taking ability of ATLAS.
I would like to thank Sergei Chekanov with whom I made my first contribution to an ATLAS paper
%, the measurement of the photon production cross-section. 
I am so glad I had the opportunity to work with Sasha Paramonov in multiple projects. 
Sasha would always find simple real life examples to convey his ideas, a way that I found both entertaining and instructive. 
I was encouraged by the group to think critically and independently, skills that are essential for any scientist.

Thanks to all the OU HEP students and Postdocs in my year. 
I start with Muhammad Alhroob who made my stay at CERN very fun. 
I shared with David shope many scuba diving trips. Yu-Ting Shen.

thanks for the good times in the mountains, on the slopes, aboard boats, under water, and at the office.

physics was more fun with your collaboration

first ATLAS conference note for ICHEP2016, second ATLAS SUSY paper with the full 2015 and 2016 data.

thanks for the good times 

I treasure all the time I spent with many friends at CERN and the Geneva area,
either be it summitting peaks in the alps, climbing, skiing on the many world class resorts in the area, 
sailing and diving in lake Geneva (or lake Leman), and taking several diving trips to lakes in the area , 
the mediternean, and the red sea.

I shared my office with Jeremy Love and Bing with whom I had such a pleasant time.

Finally, I want to thank the most important people in my life, my parents, Chouaib and Latifa, and my sister, Hafsa, 
your endless support and love during this adventure kept me always going. This dissertation is dedicated to you.
