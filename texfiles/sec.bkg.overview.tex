In this analysis, two types of backgrounds can be distinguished.
 The first category is the irreducible background from events with two same-sign prompt 
leptons or at least three prompt leptons and is estimated using the MC simulation samples. Since diboson and $\ttbar V$ events are the main 
backgrounds in the signal regions, dedicated validation regions (VR) with an enhanced contribution from these processes, and small 
signal contamination, are defined to verify the background predictions from the simulation.% (Section~\ref{sec:valid}). 
The second category is the reducible  
background, which includes events containing electrons with mismeasured charge, mainly from the production of top quark pairs, 
and events containing at least one fake or non-prompt (FNP) lepton that 
was discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{chap:fake}.
