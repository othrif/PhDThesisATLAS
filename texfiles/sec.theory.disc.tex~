The latest discoveries in particles physics are those of the 
$W$ and $Z$ bosons cite??, the top quark cite??, and the Higgs boson ??.
The path towards the discovery of these particles was guided by 
theoretical insight which gave great confidence that these particles 
should exist. 
For instance, the features of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons, such as their mass 
and production rates, were known in advance. 
Their signals stood out from the backgrounds without ambiguity.
The top quark discovery was harder, but its production and decay 
properties were predicted.
For the Higgs, there was reasonable evidence for its existence.
The production and decay of the Higgs were all known as a function of 
mass, the only missing parameter in the theory. 
In fact, these properties were also known for alternative models 
to the SM implementation of the Higgs mechanism.

Today, we do not have such theoretical guidance.
